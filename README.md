# link-state-algorithm-simulation
## simulating the link-state for network routing using Networkx package and Dijkstra algorithm
##Inputs: 
The first line of file contains the number of nodes n and edgesmEach of the next m lines contains src_node, dest_node,weight
##Outputs:
1) forwarding table for each node in the topology
2) A visualization of the originallygiven topology
